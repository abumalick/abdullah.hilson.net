I am happy to write the first post of the website. I want to launch quickly, so I will keep this post short. This website have two main purposes: to share my resume and to share my experience in programming and other topics that I believe useful.

Some topics that I may write about are:

- Paths to learn web development
- Good practices in programming
- Selection of useful tools
- Tutorials to accomplish useful tasks

I ask Allah to make this website useful for me and for others.
